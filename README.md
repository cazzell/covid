Matlab code to import state level covid tracking data and generate plots to track positive cases and testing rates

I'm mainly doing this because it's important to track both positive tests which are showing exponential growth, with testing capacity, which also must follow exponential growth to keep up. Here we can get an idea where testing is breaking down in states, and if the postive rates are trustable. I've normalized by the state population from the 2010 census.

I've additionally include plots of doubling time in days over a moving three day period for each state, and a plot of the positive test rate for each state. The positive test rate plot additionally shows if state case numbers are reasonable.
